	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a 3A Mechanical Engineering student currently attending the University of Waterloo. 
	I have gained industry experience through completing my co-op internships at The Hidi Group, Magna, and 
	Kirkor Architects and Planners. I am currently looking for a position that will allow me to expand and broaden my 
	knowledge in the field of Mechanical Engineering. I'm interested in design and hope to pursue a career in the 
	field of Product Design. In my spare time I enjoy creating art, playing bass guitar, and snowboarding.</p>
